            Hello!
            <br>
            My name is <strong>Alexander Cormier</strong>, and I go by Xander. I am a junior at <a href="https://www.acalanes.k12.ca.us/laslomas" target="_blank">Las Lomas High School</a> in Walnut Creek, CA. I have an ever-growing interest in computer science, music, math and physics.
            Aside from my various hobbies, I love to spend time working on my academics, with my family, playing cello in one of my orchestras, and working in my community! 
            <br>
            I have been on my schools' honor roll since 6th grade - doing while juggling homework with my life outside of school. I am in <a href="https://www.boysteamcharity.org/" target="_blank">boys team charity</a>, a group of kids in grades 8-12 that volunteer in various places around the county. I am both in the Science Olympiad club and the Treasurer of the quiz bowl club in my school, which is a club based around academic competition with other people and schools.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-header">ABOUT ME</h2>
        <img class="code-image" src="Images/code.jpg">
        <p>           
        Since I was a kid, I was always interested in video games and computers. Soon, I developed a desire to start making, instead of playing them, and learnt more about coding (c#, java, and html to be specific). Now, I am using my past skills to make new projects that combine my newfound interest in physics with my knowledge of computer science.
        <br>
        Cello is another passion of mine, in which I started when I was five. Over the last 10 (almost eleven!) years I learnt many new and interesting songs and techniques, and even dabbled in arranging music! I am part of both the <a href="https://contracostachamberorchestra.org/" target="_blank">Contra Costa Chamber Orchestra</a>, the Center For Community Arts Cello Ensemble, which is a group of cello players that are all in high school and preform at various concerts and events, and I also am the first chair cellist in my school's orchestra. Other groups I am a part of are the <a href="https://www.ypsomusic.org/" target="_blank">The Young People's Symphony Orchestra</a>, and the East Bay Chamber Orchestra.
        <br>
        </p>
        <p>
        My cello teacher is Stephen Evens, who has a BA in Cello Preformance and a MA in Orchestra Performance. He leads my Cello Ensemble, and is an incredibly skilled and passionate teacher. He can be contacted at stephen.evans29@gmail.com.
        <br>
        Me and a few friends from my school orchestra formed a chamber group together. We are playing in various events and places, such as retirement homes, parties, and outside in downtown. We consist of:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Andrew Park - Violin 1</li>
                <li>Ethan Jacoby - Violin 2</li>
                <li>Alexander Cormier - Cello</li>
                <li>Tre Johnson - Bass</li> 
            </ul>

        <h3>Interesting Careers</h3>
        <p>Throughout my studying in high school, I have had many different ideas about what I would want to do for my future. I am passionate about my musical interests, but am not really considering it as either a major or a career path. I love computer science and coding, but it is too competitive and unrewarding for the competition it invokes.
        <br>
        My interests in Careers and Majors is mainly in departments of Physics, Mechanical Engineering, and Mathematics. These are all incredibly interesting fields of work that are all widely varied in what careers each of these subjects can offer. It's also incredibly interesting to see how the world literally works - through physics - and try to replicate it through equations online (See my WIP projects!). I can't wait to see how future discoveries in these fields will influnce the world of tomorrow!</p>
