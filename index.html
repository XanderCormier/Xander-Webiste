            Hello!
            <br>
            My name is <strong>Alexander Cormier</strong>, but you can call me Xander. I am currently a junior at <a href="https://www.acalanes.k12.ca.us/laslomas" target="_blank">Las Lomas High School</a> in Walnut Creek, CA. My interests span across computer science, music, math, and physics, which I find incredibly fascinating. When I'm not pursuing my hobbies, I dedicate my time to academics, spending quality moments with my family, playing the cello in orchestras, and contributing to my community.
            <br>
            Maintaining a spot on the honor roll since 6th grade has been a testament to my dedication to both schoolwork and extracurricular activities. I'm an active member of <a href="https://www.boysteamcharity.org/" target="_blank">boys team charity</a>, a volunteer group for students in grades 8-12. Additionally, I participate in the Science Olympiad club and hold the position of Treasurer in the quiz bowl club, where I engage in academic competitions with other individuals and schools.

        <h2 class="section-header">ABOUT ME</h2>
        <img class="code-image" src="Images/code.jpg">
        <p>           
        Ever since I was a child, I've been captivated by video games and computers. As I grew older, my desire to create rather than just play games led me to delve into coding. I've honed my skills in languages such as C#, Java, and HTML. Currently, I'm utilizing my programming knowledge to develop projects that combine my newfound interest in physics with computer science.        
        <br>
        Cello is another passion of mine, in which I started when I was five. Over the last 10 (almost eleven!) years I learnt many new and interesting songs and techniques, and even dabbled in arranging music! I am part of both the <a href="https://contracostachamberorchestra.org/" target="_blank">Contra Costa Chamber Orchestra</a>, the Center for Community Arts Cello Ensemble, and I hold the first chair position in my school's orchestra. Additionally, I'm a member of <a href="https://www.ypsomusic.org/" target="_blank">The Young People's Symphony Orchestra</a> and the East Bay Chamber Orchestra. My cello teacher, Stephen Evans, is an exceptional instructor with expertise in cello performance. You can reach him at stephen.evans29@gmail.com.
        <br>
        </p>
        <p>
        Alongside my fellow orchestra members, I've formed a chamber group. We perform at various events, including retirement homes, parties, and outdoor venues in downtown. Our group consists of Andrew Park on Violin 1, Ethan Jacoby on Violin 2, myself on Cello, and Tre Johnson on Bass.
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Andrew Park - Violin 1</li>
                <li>Ethan Jacoby - Violin 2</li>
                <li>Mariana Castellanos - Viola</li> 
                <li>Alexander Cormier - Cello</li>

        <h3>Interesting Careers</h3>
        <p>
        My future aspirations lie primarily in the fields of Physics, Mechanical Engineering, and Mathematics. These disciplines offer an array of exciting career opportunities. I'm particularly fascinated by how physics uncovers the inner workings of the world and how we can replicate it through equations online (check out my work-in-progress projects!). I eagerly anticipate the future discoveries in these fields and their impact on shaping the world of tomorrow!
